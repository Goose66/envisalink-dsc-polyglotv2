# envisalink-dsc-polyglotv2
A Nodeserver for Polyglot v2 that interfaces with a DSC PowerSeries alarm panel through an EnvisaLink EVL-3/4 adapater. See http://www.eyezon.com/?page_id=176 for more information on the EnvisaLink EVL-4.

Instructions for manual, co-resident installation:

1. Copy the files from this repository to the folder ~/.polyglot/nodeservers/EnvisaLink-DSC in your Polyglot v2 installation.
2. Log into the Polyglot Version 2 Dashboard (https://(Polyglot IP address):3000)
3. Add the EnvisaLink-DSC nodeserver as a Local nodeserver type.
4. Add the following required Custom Configuration Parameters under Configuration:
```
    ipaddress - IP address of EnvisaLink EVL-4
    password - password for EnvisaLink device
    usercode - user code for DSC alarm panel
```
5. Add the following optional Custom Configuration Parameters:
```
    numpartitions - number of partition nodes to generate (defaults to 1)
    numzones - number of zone nodes to generate (defaults to 8)
    numcmdouts - number of command output nodes to generate (defaults to 4)
```
Here are the known issues with this version:

1. The command output nodes are currently limited to partition 1 only. These Command Output nodes send DON commands, but not DOF commands.
2. Initially, the several state values are unknown when the nodeserver starts and will default to 0 (or last known value if restarted). This includes trouble states, door chime, and the like. These state values may not be correct until the status is changed while the nodeserver is running.
3. When the nodeserver starts, it sends keystrokes to the keypad to dump bypass zones to get set the initial zone bypass attributes. This causes the keypad to beep and may cause a Security Event alert (text and/or email) to be generated by EyezON.
4. The Nodeserver will write an error message to the log and exit if one of the Customer Configuration Parameters is missing. No notifications are sent to the ISY.
